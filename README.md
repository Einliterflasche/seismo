# seismo

A lightweight script for automatically building and viewing LaTeX projects managed by [tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/).

### Limitations
Note that it assumes the `xdg-open` command is available. It will thus probably only work on linux.

### Installation
Simply clone the repo and then install like this:
```console
git clone https://github.com/Einliterflasche/seismo
cd seismo
cargo install --path .
```
